# ðŸ§  C++ Master Companion â€” Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To understand how C++ models real-world problems using objects â€” encapsulating data and behavior â€” while learning to design robust, reusable, and extensible software.

---

## 1. What is OOP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a paradigm where **data** and **functions** that operate on that data are grouped together into **objects**.

**Core Idea:** Represent real-world entities as code objects.

### 4 Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation** â€“ Binding data and functions into one unit (class).
2. **Abstraction** â€“ Hiding complex details, exposing only essentials.
3. **Inheritance** â€“ Deriving new classes from existing ones to reuse code.
4. **Polymorphism** â€“ Using a single interface to represent different forms.

---

## 2. Classes and Objects

A **class** is a blueprint; an **object** is an instance of that blueprint.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        cout << brand << " is driving at " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car c1;               // Object creation
    c1.brand = "Tesla";
    c1.speed = 120;
    c1.drive();
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Syntax breakdown:**

* `class ClassName { ... };` â†’ defines a class.
* `object.member` â†’ access member data/functions.

---

## 3. Access Specifiers

| Access Level | Visibility                                  | Use Case        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `public`     | Accessible anywhere                         | Interface       |
| `private`    | Accessible only within the class            | Data protection |
| `protected`  | Accessible within class and derived classes | Inheritance     |

ðŸ”’ **Encapsulation in practice:**

```cpp
class Account {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    double getBalance() const { return balance; }
};
```

---

## 4. Constructors and Destructors

### Constructor

A **constructor** initializes an object automatically when itâ€™s created.

```cpp
class Student {
    string name;
public:
    Student(string n) { name = n; }
};
```

### Types:

1. Default constructor â†’ `Student() {}`
2. Parameterized constructor â†’ `Student(string n)`
3. Copy constructor â†’ `Student(const Student &obj)`

### Destructor

Cleans up when object goes out of scope.

```cpp
~Student() { cout << "Destructor called!"; }
```

ðŸ’¡ Rule of Three: If you define **destructor**, define **copy constructor** and **copy assignment operator** too.

---

## 5. `this` Pointer

Refers to the current object inside a member function.

```cpp
void setName(string name) { this->name = name; }
```

Used to:

* Differentiate between class attributes and parameters.
* Return current object (for chaining).

---

## 6. Static Members

Shared by all objects of the class.

```cpp
class Counter {
public:
    static int count;
    Counter() { count++; }
};
int Counter::count = 0;
```

âœ… Access via class name â†’ `Counter::count`.

---

## 7. Friend Functions & Classes

Allow non-member functions or other classes to access private/protected data.

```cpp
class Box {
private:
    int width;
public:
    Box(int w) : width(w) {}
    friend void printWidth(Box b);
};

void printWidth(Box b) { cout << b.width; }
```

Use **sparingly** â€” it breaks encapsulation.

---

## 8. Inheritance

Allows creation of new classes from existing ones.

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() { cout << "Starting...\n"; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() { cout << "Beep!\n"; }
};
```

### Syntax

```cpp
class Derived : access_modifier Base { ... };
```

### Types of Inheritance

* **Single** â†’ One base, one derived.
* **Multiple** â†’ Multiple bases.
* **Multilevel** â†’ Chain of inheritance.
* **Hierarchical** â†’ One base, many derived.
* **Hybrid** â†’ Combination of above.

ðŸ§© **`protected` members** are visible to derived classes but hidden from the outside world.

---

## 9. Polymorphism

Means "many forms" â€” same interface, different behaviors.

### 1. Compile-Time (Static)

**Function Overloading** and **Operator Overloading**.

Example:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b);
double add(double a, double b);
```

### 2. Run-Time (Dynamic)

Achieved via **virtual functions** and **base class pointers**.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() { cout << "Drawing Shape\n"; }
};
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle\n"; }
};
```

âœ… Use `virtual` keyword in base class â†’ ensures correct function call at runtime.

---

## 10. Abstract Classes & Interfaces

Abstract class â†’ has at least one **pure virtual function**.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

Cannot instantiate; must be inherited and implemented.

---

## 11. Operator Overloading

Redefine operator behavior for user-defined types.

```cpp
class Complex {
    int real, imag;
public:
    Complex(int r, int i): real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator + (Complex const &obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
};
```

ðŸ”§ Overload only when it adds **semantic clarity**, not confusion.

## ðŸ§© Quick Review Checklist

â˜‘ Understand class/object difference
â˜‘ Use constructors/destructors properly
â˜‘ Apply access modifiers wisely
â˜‘ Create baseâ€“derived relationships
â˜‘ Use virtual functions for polymorphism
â˜‘ Avoid overusing friend functions
â˜‘ Follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

## ðŸ’ª Practice Ideas

1. **Bank System:** Accounts, transactions, balance updates.
2. **Library Management:** Books, members, borrowing system.
3. **Shape Hierarchy:** Circle, Rectangle, Triangle using polymorphism.
4. **Smart Calculator:** Operator overloading for different datatypes.
5. **Employee Management System:** Base and derived roles.
