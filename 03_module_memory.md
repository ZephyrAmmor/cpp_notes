# üß† Module 3: Memory and Pointers

> "Memory is where your program truly lives ‚Äî manage it wisely, and it will serve you faithfully. Mismanage it, and it will haunt you."

---

## üîπ Overview

This module covers one of the most **fundamental yet error-prone** aspects of C++ ‚Äî **memory management**. Mastering pointers, references, and ownership models separates a good programmer from a great one. This is where you learn to think *like the compiler* and *like the CPU*.

## üì¶ 3.1 Stack vs Heap

### Concept Overview

* **Stack:** Automatically managed memory for local variables. Fast, but limited in size.
* **Heap:** Dynamically allocated memory controlled manually by the programmer.

### Visual

```
Memory Layout:
+---------------------+  High Address
|     Heap (dynamic)  |  ‚Üê grows upward
|---------------------|
|        Stack        |  ‚Üê grows downward
|---------------------|
|   Code / Data Segs  |
+---------------------+  Low Address
```

### Example

```cpp
void example() {
    int a = 10;           // Stored on stack
    int* b = new int(20); // Stored on heap
    
    std::cout << a << ", " << *b;
    delete b;             // Manual cleanup
}
```

### Pitfall

‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory Leak:** Forgetting to `delete` heap memory results in wasted memory that never returns to the OS.

### Insight

üí° **Stack** memory is automatically reclaimed when the function exits, while **heap** memory must be explicitly freed.

---

## üß∑ 3.2 Pointers and References

### Concept Overview

Pointers store **addresses**, not values. References are **aliases** ‚Äî safer and simpler.

### Syntax Block

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* ptr = &x;   // pointer to x
int& ref = x;    // reference to x
```

### Example

```cpp
void update(int* p, int& r) {
    *p += 10;
    r += 20;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    update(&a, a);
    std::cout << a; // Output: 35
}
```

### Pitfalls

* **Dangling Pointer:** Using a pointer to deleted memory.
* **Null Pointer Dereference:** Dereferencing `nullptr` causes a crash.

### Insight

üí° **References cannot be reseated** ‚Äî once bound, they refer to the same object forever.

---

## üß± 3.3 Dynamic Memory Allocation

### Concept Overview

C++ lets you allocate memory dynamically with `new` and release it with `delete`.

### Syntax

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(42);
delete ptr; // Always match new/delete

int* arr = new int[5];
delete[] arr; // Always match new[]/delete[]
```

### Best Practice

‚úÖ Prefer **smart pointers** (see below) to avoid manual memory management.

---

## üß† 3.4 Smart Pointers

### Concept Overview

Smart pointers automate memory management using RAII ‚Äî **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**.

### Common Types

| Smart Pointer     | Header     | Ownership Model     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `std::unique_ptr` | `<memory>` | Sole ownership      |
| `std::shared_ptr` | `<memory>` | Shared ownership    |
| `std::weak_ptr`   | `<memory>` | Non-owning observer |

### Example

```cpp
#include <memory>

void smart_example() {
    auto p1 = std::make_unique<int>(10);  // unique ownership
    auto p2 = std::make_shared<int>(20);  // shared ownership
    auto p3 = p2;                         // shared ownership count++
    
    std::weak_ptr<int> wp = p2;           // non-owning reference
}
```

### Under the Hood

üß† Smart pointers use **reference counting** (for `shared_ptr`) and **move semantics** (for `unique_ptr`) to ensure deterministic cleanup.

### Pitfall

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cyclic References:** Two `shared_ptr` pointing to each other never free memory ‚Äî use `weak_ptr` to break cycles.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3.5 RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

### Concept Overview

RAII ensures that resources are acquired and released automatically when objects go in/out of scope.

### Example

```cpp
#include <fstream>

void readFile() {
    std::ifstream file("data.txt"); // Opens file
    if (!file) return;
    // File automatically closes when function exits
}
```

### Insight

üí° Constructors acquire resources, destructors release them ‚Äî **no explicit cleanup needed.**

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 3.6 Move Semantics and Ownership

### Concept Overview

Introduced in **C++11**, move semantics transfer ownership of resources instead of copying.

### Example

```cpp
#include <utility>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> makeVector() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
    return v; // Moved, not copied
}

int main() {
    auto data = makeVector();
}
```

### Under the Hood

üß† When returning local objects, the compiler uses **Return Value Optimization (RVO)** or **move constructors** to avoid deep copies.

### Best Practice

‚úÖ Implement move constructors and assignment operators if your class manages resources manually.

## üîç 3.7 Common Memory Bugs

| Bug Type                  | Description                         | Example                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Dangling Pointer**      | Pointer to deallocated memory       | `int* p = new int(5); delete p; *p = 10;` |
| **Memory Leak**           | Memory not released                 | `new int(5); // no delete`                |
| **Double Free**           | Deleting same pointer twice         | `delete p; delete p;`                     |
| **Uninitialized Pointer** | Using pointer before initialization | `int* p; *p = 10;`                        |

### Tip

üîç Use **Valgrind**, **ASan**, or **Visual Studio Address Sanitizer** to detect memory issues.

---

## üß© 3.8 Under the Hood: How Allocation Works

* **`new`** requests memory from the **heap allocator** (usually `malloc` internally).
* The allocator maintains **free lists** of available blocks.
* **Smart pointers** wrap these allocations with destructors that automatically free memory when no longer referenced.

### Visualization

```
std::shared_ptr<int> a = std::make_shared<int>(42);
     ‚îÇ
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> Heap: [42]
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Control Block: [ref_count = 1]
```

### Insight

üí° Every dynamic allocation costs time ‚Äî avoid excessive small allocations in performance-critical code.

---

## ‚úÖ 3.9 Best Practices Summary

* Prefer **stack** over **heap** unless dynamic lifetime is required.
* Use **smart pointers** instead of raw pointers.
* Follow **RAII**: wrap resources in objects.
* Avoid **manual delete** ‚Äî let destructors or smart pointers handle cleanup.
* Use **move semantics** for efficiency.
* Regularly test with **memory sanitizers**.

---

**Availability:** Core since C++98; Smart Pointers and Move Semantics added in C++11.
