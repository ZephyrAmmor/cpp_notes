# Chapter 5: Structs, Enums, and Code Grouping

This chapter focuses on C++'s fundamental tools for creating custom, composite data types: `struct`s and `enum`s. These constructs allow you to aggregate related data and to create type-safe, readable constants.

## 5.1 Structs and Data Aggregation

**Why use structs?** A `struct` (structure) is C++'s way of letting you create a new data type by bundling together other variables. This is the foundation of data aggregation. Instead of passing around a loose collection of variables (`string name`, `int id`, `double gpa`), you can group them into a single logical unit (`Student student`), making your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to understand.

By default, all members of a `struct` are `public`, meaning they can be accessed directly.

```cpp
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

Point p = {10.5, -20.0}; // Aggregate initialization
std::cout << "X: " << p.x << ", Y: " << p.y << std::endl;
```

### `struct` vs. `class` in C++

This is a common point of confusion. The **only** technical difference is the default access level:
*   `struct`: Default member and inheritance access is **`public`**.
*   `class`: Default member and inheritance access is **`private`**.

**So which should you use?** The C++ community has established a strong convention:
*   Use **`struct`** for **Plain Old Data (POD)** or simple data aggregates whose primary purpose is to bundle data. You are signaling that it's okay to directly access the members.
*   Use **`class`** when you need to enforce **invariants**â€”rules about the state of your object. By making data `private` and providing `public` methods, you control how the data is modified, which is the principle of encapsulation.

### Plain Old Data (POD) and Standard Layout

**Why does POD matter?** This concept is crucial for interoperability, especially with C libraries. C code doesn't understand C++ features like constructors, private members, or virtual functions. A POD `struct` has a simple, predictable memory layout that C can understand, so you can safely pass a pointer to one to a C function.

In modern C++, the concept is refined into **Standard-Layout Types**. A type is considered standard-layout if it (among other rules):
*   Has no virtual functions or virtual base classes.
*   Has all its non-static data members with the same access control (`public`, `private`, etc.).
*   Has no user-provided constructors or destructors (in many cases).

### Memory Padding and Alignment

**Why does this happen?** For performance. A CPU can read a 4-byte `int` or an 8-byte `double` much more efficiently if it is located at a memory address that is a multiple of its size (e.g., a 4-byte `int` at address 1000, not 1001). This is called **alignment**.

To enforce this, the compiler will insert unused bytes, called **padding**, between or after the members of a struct to ensure each member is correctly aligned.

**How it works:**

```cpp
// On a typical 64-bit system where double is 8-byte aligned
struct BadLayout {
    char a;     // 1 byte
    // 7 bytes of padding inserted by compiler
    double b;   // 8 bytes
    int c;      // 4 bytes
    // 4 bytes of padding inserted for overall alignment
};
// sizeof(BadLayout) will likely be 24!

struct GoodLayout {
    double b;   // 8 bytes
    int c;      // 4 bytes
    char a;     // 1 byte
    // 3 bytes of padding inserted for overall alignment
};
// sizeof(GoodLayout) will likely be 16!
```
By reordering members from largest to smallest, you can often minimize the amount of padding the compiler needs to add, resulting in a smaller memory footprint.

## 5.2 Enumerations and Scoped Enums

**Why use enums?** Enums solve the "magic number" problem. Instead of writing `if (errorCode == 2)`, which is unreadable, you can write `if (errorCode == Error::NotFound)`, which is self-documenting and far less error-prone.

### Traditional C-style `enum`

This is the original enum from C. It's essentially a set of named integer constants.

**What are its flaws?**
1.  **Scope Pollution:** The enumerator names (`RED`, `GREEN`) leak into the surrounding scope. This can easily cause name collisions in large projects.
2.  **Implicit Conversion to `int`:** They automatically convert to integers, which allows for nonsensical comparisons between unrelated types.

```cpp
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
enum Fruit { BANANA, APPLE };

if (RED == BANANA) { // Compiles! Both convert to 0. This is a logical error.
    // ...
}
```

### `enum class` (Scoped Enums)

C++11 introduced **scoped enums** to fix these problems. They are the modern, preferred way to create enumerations.

**Why are they better?**
1.  **Scoped:** The enumerator names are contained within the enum's scope. You must use `Color::Red`, which avoids name collisions.
2.  **Strongly Typed:** They do not implicitly convert to `int` or any other type. This prevents the nonsensical comparisons seen above.

```cpp
enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
enum class Fruit { Banana, Apple };

// if (Color::Red == Fruit::Banana) { // COMPILE ERROR! No conversion between types.
//     // ...
// }

// To get the integer value, you must be explicit:
int color_value = static_cast<int>(Color::Red); // OK
```

### Specifying the Underlying Type

**Why do this?** By default, the underlying type of an `enum class` is `int`. You can specify a different integral type to control its memory size. This is useful for interoperating with hardware registers that expect a specific size, or for making data structures more compact.

```cpp
// This enum will use only 1 byte of memory instead of the default 4 (for an int).
enum class Status : std::uint8_t {
    Pending,
    Processing,
    Complete,
    Failed
};
```

## Projects for Chapter 5

### Project 1: The RGB Color Mixer

*   **Problem Statement:** Create a `struct` named `Color` that contains three `unsigned char` members: `r`, `g`, and `b`. Write a function `Color mix_colors(const Color& c1, const Color& c2)` that takes two colors and returns a new `Color` where each component is the average of the input colors. In `main`, create red (`{255, 0, 0}`) and blue (`{0, 0, 255}`) colors, mix them, and print the `r, g, b` values of the resulting purple color.
*   **Core Concepts to Apply:** `struct` definition, member access, aggregate initialization, passing structs to functions.

### Project 2: The Alignment Investigator

*   **Problem Statement:** Create two structs, `InefficientLayout` and `EfficientLayout`. Both should contain the same three members: `char status;`, `double value;`, and `int id;`. In `InefficientLayout`, order them as listed. In `EfficientLayout`, reorder them from largest to smallest. In `main`, print the `sizeof` each struct and observe the difference. Add comments to your code explaining why padding causes `InefficientLayout` to be larger.
*   **Core Concepts to Apply:** Memory padding, alignment, `sizeof` operator on structs.

### Project 3: The Vending Machine State Machine

*   **Problem Statement:** You are modeling a simple vending machine. Create a scoped enumeration `enum class VendingState : std::uint8_t { Idle, AcceptingMoney, DispensingItem };`. Write a function `void handle_state(VendingState current_state)` that takes a state and prints a different message for each one (e.g., "Idle: Please insert money.", "Dispensing: Your item is on its way."). In `main`, create a `VendingState` variable, cycle it through all three states, and call your function for each one.
*   **Core Concepts to Apply:** `enum class` for type-safe states, specifying the underlying type, using enums in functions.
